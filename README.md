# Kubric-Trello-Clone

Kubric coding challenge

## Installing and Running

To set up everything you need to run this program just type npm install in your terminal</br>
To run the project type npm start in your terminal </br>

## Project Rundown

I was able to create a trello board that you can add new cards and new lists to you board.</br>
Unfortunatly, I didn't have time to quite get the redux right to enable deletions or updates to </br>
the cards and lists so you better type accuratly (lol).</br></br>
I do think that given another short amount of time I'd be able to get everything done in the challenge</br>
including the extra thing like tests (which you can see in my file structure I had every intention of)</br>
In any case thank you for your time, all the best and good luck at Kubric!

## Thanks!

I'd just like to take a quick second to thank you for the chance to do some coding for you!</br>
This challenge was a lot of fun to work through and I learned a lot of things in the process</br>
Configuring webpack being one of the major headaches, but now I feel far far more comfortiable with it.</br>
